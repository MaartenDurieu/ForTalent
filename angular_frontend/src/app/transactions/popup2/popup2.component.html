  <p>Accepting this offer ends the negotiation for this listing. The listing will no longer appear as available and
    you will also not be able to make any changes or look at the proposal history anymore.
    Once accepted, the listing will be made invisible untill the proposed pay is paid. When the payment is received from the venue
    the listing will be added to your profile and calendar publicly. The listing will appear on the profile of the venue aswell.
