<mat-dialog-content class="mat-typography">
  <p>Accepting this offer ends the negotiation for this listing. The listing will no longer appear as available and
    all other ongoing proposals with others will be deleted. You will also not be able to make any changes or look at the proposal history anymore.
    Once accepted, the listing will be made invisible untill the negotiated amount is paid. When the payment is received from you,
    the listing will be added to your profile and calendar publicly. The listing will also appear on the profile of the artists aswell.
